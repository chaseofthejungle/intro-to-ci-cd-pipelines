# Intro to CI/CD Pipelines
**Definition/Overview:** The Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) process flow paradigm empowers software development and DevOps teams to combine the stages of their efforts into an easily trackable/manageable and automatable product life cycle. Adherence to CI/CD principles promotes streamlined app coding/programming, testing, and deployment processes. Meanwhile, a version control system (VCS) is utilized to create and maintain depositories for easy consultation, cutover, and restoration/rollback.

The four overarching phases/stages of the CI/CD pipeline include: *version control*, *building*, *testing*, and *deployment*.

## 1. <a name="essentials">Essential Characteristics of CI/CD Process Flow</a>

* Automated integration and unit testing, promoting healthy app builds.
* Flexibility around functionality, performance, and security-related needs.
* Quality assurance via the *static analysis* of committed code. 
* Routine *code commits and immediate testing*, exhibited through a VCS (e.g., Git).
  + This protects the production environment and halts building and releasing as necessary.
* Streamlining delivery *after* integration, dedicating focus to trustworthy deployments.
* Validation of code quality at each stage/phase of the CI/CD pipeline.
